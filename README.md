# Spelling Quiz Website.

The aim of this website is to test users on spelling. The application uses google pronunciation to read the words stored in the array. The user then enters the word and a tick or cross sign will appear along with an ooops or bell noise, indicating wether the user is correct or not. Words are called randomly in each session and more or dfferent words can be added to the array. When the quiz is complete the user will be displayed their final score along with they words they got wrong or if a perfect score is achieved, a congratulatory message is displayed at the bottom of the page.

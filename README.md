# Spelling Quiz Website.

The aim of this website is to test users on their spelling. The application uses google audio pronunciation to read the words stored in the array. The user then enters the word and a tick or cross sign will appear along with an ooops or bell noise, indicating wether the user is correct or not. Words are called randomly in each session and more or different words can be added to the array. When the quiz is complete the user will be shown their final score along with the words they got wrong or if a perfect score is achieved, a congratulatory message is displayed at the bottom of the page.
